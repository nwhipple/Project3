Project 3: Exploration of Nuclear Power 

Overview and Purpose

Nuclear power has been a potential energy generation option since the 1950s, initially heralded as the dawn of a new era for humanity. However, its promise was quickly overshadowed by several high-profile nuclear incidents, leading to widespread political and economic hesitation. Despite this, many countries are now reconsidering nuclear power, building and operating new plants to meet their electricity needs. This project aims to explore the viability of nuclear power as a clean energy source, assess its safety, examine the adoption rates across different countries, and analyze the economic trends related to nuclear plant construction.

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

Waste Created by Energy Type: This is a static chart designed to show the amount of waste created by different energy sources. By hovering over the bar charts, you can see the numerical measure for each source
Nuclear Power Plants Dashboard: Click on a bubble to learn more about nuclear reactors, their status, and their output. Be sure to zoom in close to click on bubbles that seem overlapping. The radius of the bubbles represents the output of the reactor plant.
Incident Map: Click on a bubble to learn more about a nuclear incident. The radius of the bubble represents the severity of the nuclear incident, as measured by the INES rating system.
Reactor Cost Dashboard: Analyze cost trends per kW by country. Change the country in the drop down menu and see the different nuclear reactors built in that country and the prices in 2010 USD per kW.

Ethical considerations made in the project

We requested data from the Global Energy Monitor which is a government organization. Importantly, none of the data used contains personally identifiable information. Our intention is to use this publicly available data to analyze the suitability of nuclear power on a global scale, ensuring our research adheres to ethical standards.
